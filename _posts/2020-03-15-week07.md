## Merging vs. Rebasing
During the lecture this Monday, we continued to lean about Git with a focus on `merge` vs. `rebase` and when to use each. From my understanding,  `merge` creates a single commit record by combining the changes in two different branches, while `rebase` rewrites the commit history by creating new commits which results in a clean, linear project history. I’ve only used `merge` in the past,  and imo I’d prefer using `merge` in the future as I’d like to preserve the complete history of the project. But it is good to know how the the `rebase` command as well since it might be useful in work. 

I also learned about the commit object and the head pointer in Git from the lecture. Although I’ve been using Git for quite a while, I’ve never actually thought about how it works behind the scenes. For the first time I learned that commits are objects,  and Git maintains a head pointer that points to the current branch. When you switch to a different branch, Git simply moves the pointer to that branch. This was all quite new to me and made me feel that I should read more about the design principles of Git in order to get more comfortable with the workflow.
