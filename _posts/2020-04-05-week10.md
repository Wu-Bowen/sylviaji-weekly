It’s getting harder and harder to place an order with any grocery delivery service out there. Every time I try to check out my Amazon Fresh cart, there is never any delivery window available. And the same situation for FreshDirect, Instacart, Shipt…you name it. I ended up using this [Amazon Fresh delivery slot finder](https://github.com/ahertel/Amazon-Fresh-Whole-Foods-delivery-slot-finder), a tool that helped me finally succeed in placing an order with Amazon Fresh. The project is under the MIT license and contributions are welcomed, so I guess it is fair to call it open-source. Confession time: I kinda feel bad for using the tool, for the reason that I am gaining advantage over other people with technology, which is unfair.  But without it I might never be able to get a delivery slot on my own. Such a dilemma :(
